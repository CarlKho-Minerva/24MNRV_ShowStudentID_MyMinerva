# Minerva Student ID Chrome Extension

**Note:** This project is created for fun and educational purposes only. It is not an official Minerva Schools product, nor is it endorsed by Minerva. This extension was built simply to practice my CS skills in a new domain (browser extensions) and help fellow students by offering a quick and convenient way to access their student IDs.

‚≠ê stars appreciated if it was useful for you!
